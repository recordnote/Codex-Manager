## Recent Changes
- Current latest version: `v0.1.9` (2026-03-18)
- This release is centered on a full UI refresh and consolidation under the new `apps` frontend: the old frontend was removed, while Accounts, Platform Keys, Request Logs, Settings, the top status bar, and the sidebar were all rebuilt into a denser desktop-first layout with cleaner filtering, dialogs, and summary cards.
- The request path was further aligned to actual Codex behavior, but only where it affects real request delivery: login / callback / workspace validation, refresh semantics, `/v1/responses` and `/v1/responses/compact` rewrites, thread anchors, `session_id` / `x-client-request-id` / `x-codex-turn-state`, request compression, and fallback diagnostics were all tightened.
- Account routing and usability also improved: free / weekly-single-window accounts now consistently use the configured model override; preferred-account routing, failover behavior, inflight limits, and refresh-token false inactivation were all corrected, and request logs now expose both the initial account and the attempted chain.
- Observability is much stronger: request logs now use backend pagination and backend summaries, while compact false-success bodies, HTML/challenge pages, `401 refresh` reasons, and `503 no available account` failures all produce clearer diagnostics instead of ambiguous generic errors.
- Desktop stability and startup behavior were cleaned up as well: service startup false negatives, `/rpc` empty responses, stale usage-dialog data, first-switch lag, hydration mismatches, and misleading dev render indicators were all addressed, and the Web password setting now stays in sync between desktop and Web.
- The release path was also normalized: the product version is now `0.1.9`, the Tauri Rust side and workflow Tauri CLI / pnpm versions are aligned again, and `release-all.yml` remains the single release entry for Windows / macOS / Linux. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full history.

## Features
- Account pool management: groups, tags, sorting, notes
- Bulk import / export: multi-file import, recursive desktop folder import for JSON, one-file-per-account export
- Usage dashboard: 5-hour + 7-day windows, plus accounts that only expose a 7-day window
- OAuth login: browser flow + manual callback parsing
- Platform keys: create, disable, delete, model binding
- Local service with configurable port
- Local OpenAI-compatible gateway for CLI and third-party tools

## Quick Start
1. Launch the desktop app and click `Start Service`.
2. Go to Accounts, add an account, and complete authorization.
3. If callback parsing fails, paste the callback URL manually.
4. Refresh usage and confirm the account status.

## Page Overview
### Desktop
- Accounts: bulk import/export, refresh accounts and usage
- Platform Keys: bind keys by model and inspect request logs
- Settings: manage ports, proxy, theme, auto-update, and background behavior

### Service Edition
- `codexmanager-service`: local OpenAI-compatible gateway
- `codexmanager-web`: browser-based management UI
- `codexmanager-start`: one command to launch service + web
